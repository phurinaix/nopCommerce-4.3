Steps:
1. Make a backup of everything on your site, including the database. This is extremely important so that you can roll back to a running site no matter what happens during migration.
2. Remove all files from the previous version except \App_Data\dataSettings.json and \App_Data\plugins.json (move them to the safe place).
3. Upload new site files
4. Copy back \App_Data\dataSettings.json and \App_Data\plugins.json files.
5. Ensure that everything is OK

Notes:
1. If you stored your pictures on the file system, then also backup them (\wwwroot\Images\) and copy back after upgrade
